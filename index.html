            <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external style sheet.</li>
            <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
            <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
            <li>The CSS box model consists of margins outside of an element and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>JavaScript is case sensitive.</li>
            <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
            <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
            <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the oerder in which code is executed or if it's executed at all.</li>
            <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
            <li>An array index allows us to work with individual items inside an array.</li>
            <li>Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential.</li>
            <li>A "for" loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
            <li>A "for" loop contains the following three important statements, the starting point for our loop, the condition, and the final statement.</li>
            <li>A function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
            <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses().</li>
            <li>Declaring a function in our JavaScript file does not mean that the code will automatically execute.
              We need to call the function in the code at the spot we want it to execute.
