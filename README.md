# A Guide Through Bootcamp Prework

## Description

This webpage serves as a  starting point for any person trying to navigate the topics to study while completing their bootcamp prework. I created this webpage because with the increasing popularity of coding bootcamps there is a market for resources that newly enrolled students can access to get a look into what they will be focusing on in their prework assignments. In creating this webpage I not only got to learn some of the foundational steps needed in web developement but I am able to put those steps into practice by applying them to this very webpage.
